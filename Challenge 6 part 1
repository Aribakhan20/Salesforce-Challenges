/*1. Create an APEX Trigger that runs when opportunities are created that does the following:
- Creates a task associated with the opportunity to follow up in 10 days time - use the subject 'Follow Up' (case matters!)
- If the Opportunity amount is over 500000 creates a task with the subject ‘Reduce Value’ that is associated with the opportunity, due for completion in two days.
- Set the status of these tasks to 'New'
- Assign these tasks to yourself
